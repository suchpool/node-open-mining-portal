#### Node Open Mining Portal

This portal is an extremely efficient, highly scalable, all-in-one, easy to setup cryptocurrency mining pool written
entirely in Node.js. It contains a stratum poolserver, reward/payment/share processor, and a (*not yet completed*)
front-end website.

#### Features

* For the pool server it uses the highly efficient [node-stratum-pool](//github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool) module which
supports vardiff, POW & POS, transaction messages, anti-DDoS, IP banning, [several hashing algorithms](//github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#hashing-algorithms-supported).

* The portal has an [MPOS](//github.com/MPOS/php-mpos) compatibility mode so that the it can
function as a drop-in-replacement for [python-stratum-mining](//github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining). This
mode can be enabled in the configuration and will insert shares into a MySQL database in the format which MPOS expects.

* Multi-pool ability - this software was built from the ground up to run with multiple coins simultaneously (which can
have different properties and hashing algorithms). It can be used to create a pool for a single coin or for multiple
coins at once. The pools use clustering to load balance across multiple CPU cores.

* For reward/payment processing, shares are inserted into Redis (a fast NoSQL key/value store). The PROP (proportional)
reward system is used with [Redis Transactions](http://redis.io/topics/transactions) for secure and super speedy payouts.
Each and every share will be rewarded - even for rounds resulting in orphaned blocks.

* This portal does not have user accounts/logins/registrations. Instead, miners simply use their coin address for stratum
authentication. A minimalistic HTML5 front-end connects to the portals statistics API to display stats from from each
pool such as connected miners, network/pool difficulty/hash rate, etc.

* Automated switching of connected miners to different pools/coins is also easily done due to the multi-pool architecture
of this software. To use this feature the switching must be controlled by your own script, such as one that calculates
coin profitability via an API such as CoinChoose.com or CoinWarz.com (or calculated locally using daemon-reported network
difficulties and exchange APIs). NOMP's regular payment processing and miner authentication which using coin address as stratum
username will obviously not work with this coin switching feature - so you must control those with your own script as well.


#### Attack Mitigation
* Detects and thwarts socket flooding (garbage data sent over socket in order to consume system resources).
* Detects and thwarts zombie miners (botnet infected computers connecting to your server to use up sockets but not sending any shares).
* Detects and thwarts invalid share attacks:
   * NOMP is not vulnerable to the low difficulty share exploits happening to other pool servers. Other pool server
   software has hardcoded guesstimated max difficulties for new hashing algorithms while NOMP dynamically generates the
   max difficulty for each algorithm based on values founds in coin source code.
   * IP banning feature which on a configurable threshold will ban an IP for a configurable amount of time if the miner
   submits over a configurable threshold of invalid shares.
* NOMP is written in Node.js which uses a single thread (async) to handle connections rather than the overhead of one
thread per connection, and clustering is also implemented so all CPU cores are taken advantage of.


#### Security
NOMP has some implicit security advantages for pool operators and miners:
* Without a registration/login system, non-security-oriented miners reusing passwords across pools is no longer a concern.
* Automated payouts by default and pool profits are sent to another address so pool wallets aren't plump with coins -
giving hackers little reward and keeping your pool from being a target.
* Miners can notice lack of automated payments as a possible early warning sign that an operator is about to run off with their coins.


#### Planned Features

* NOMP API - Used by the website to display stats and information about the pool(s) on the portal's front-end website,
and by the NOMP Desktop app to retrieve a list of available coins (and version-bytes for local wallet/address generation).

* To reduce variance for pools just starting out which have little to no hashing power a feature is planned which will
allow your own pool to connect upstream to a larger pool server. It will request work from the larger pool then
redistribute the work to our own connected miners.

Usage
=====


#### Requirements
* Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.10+ ([follow these installation instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager))
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ ([follow these instructions](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))


#### 0) Setting up coin daemon
Follow the build/install instructions for your coin daemon. Your coin.conf file should end up looking something like this:
```
daemon=1
rpcuser=litecoinrpc
rpcpassword=securepassword
rpcport=19332
```
For redundancy, its recommended to have at least two daemon instances running in case one drops out-of-sync or offline,
all instances will be polled for block/transaction updates and be used for submitting blocks. Creating a backup daemon
involves spawning a daemon using the `-datadir=/backup` command-line argument which creates a new daemon instance with
it's own config directory and coin.conf file. Learn about the daemon, how to use it and how it works if you want to be
a good pool operator. For starters be sure to read:

#### 1) Downloading & Installing

Clone the repository and run `npm update` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zone117x/node-open-mining-portal.git nomp
cd nomp
npm update
```

#### 2) Configuration

##### Portal config
Inside the `config_example.json` file, ensure the default configuration will work for your environment, then copy the file to `config.json`.

##### Coin config
Inside the `coins` directory, ensure a json file exists for your coin. If it does not you will have to create it.
Here is an example of the required fields:
````javascript

    "name": "Litecoin",
    "symbol": "ltc",
    "algorithm": "scrypt", //or "sha256", "scrypt-jane", "scrypt-n", "quark", "x11"
    "txMessages": false, //or true (not required, defaults to false)
    "mposDiffMultiplier": 256, //only for x11 coins in mpos mode, set to 256 (optional)

You can create as many of these pool config files as you want (such as one pool per coin you which to operate).
If you are creating multiple pools, ensure that they have unique stratum ports.

For more information on these configuration options see the [pool module documentation](https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#module-usage)



##### [Optional, recommended] Setting up blocknotify
1. In `config.json` set the port and password for `blockNotifyListener`
2. In your daemon conf file set the `blocknotify` command to use:
```
node [path to scripts/blockNotify.js] [listener host]:[listener port] [listener password] [coin name in config] %s
```
Example: inside `dogecoin.conf` add the line
```
blocknotify="node scripts/blockNotify.js localhost:8117 mySuperSecurePassword dogecoin %s"
if you get "not found" or "runCommand error: system(......) returned 32512 in debug.log, add sh -c
blocknotify=sh -c "node scripts/blockNotify.js localhost:8117 mySuperSecurePassword dogecoin %s"
```

Alternatively, you can use a more efficient block notify script written in pure C. Build and usage instructions
are commented in [scripts/blocknotify.c](scripts/blocknotify.c).


#### 3) Start the portal

```bash
node init.js
```

###### Optional enhancements for your awesome new mining pool server setup:
* Use something like [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to keep the node script running
in case the master process crashes. 
* Use something like [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander) to have a nice GUI
for exploring your redis database.
* Use something like [logrotator](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/logrotate-examples/) to rotate log 
output from NOMP.
* Use [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) to monitor your NOMP instance and server performance.


#### Upgrading NOMP
When updating NOMP to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update the `node-statum-pool` module and any config files that may have been changed.
* Inside your NOMP directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest NOMP code.
* Remove the dependenices by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
* Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
* Compare your `config.json` and `pool_configs/coin.json` configurations to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. You may need to modify or add any new changes.
